Collection:Collection is composite data type which can compose of one or more feild 
           In Oracle pl/sql ,collection is single dimensional array
           It consist of one or more element accessible by its index value
           all the element have same data type
           
           ram  mohan  sai
           1    2      3
           
  Advantage:
           1.Bulk collect:
             select select statement that retreive multiple row with the single fetch,increase the spped of data retreival
           2.easy and simplify
           
  Terminology:
           1.Dense collection: there must be no gap between the element 
             ram  mohan  sai
             1      2     3
           2.Sparse Collection:There could be gap between element
              ram         sai
              1      2     3

  Types of collection:
 1.Index by Table(Associative array)
             Collection is Indexed BINARY_INTEGER values or Varchar2 values which do not need to consecutive
             We can not store this collection into database
             They were originally called pl/sql
             You do not need to be initialize a associative array location
  
  EXAMPLE:
  declare
type Student_type is table of varchar2(100) index by BINARY_INTEGER;
Students Student_type;
idx number;
begin
Students(1):='Mike';
Students(2):='John';
Students(3):='Akshay';
Students(6):='varun';
Students(7):='Arjun';

Students.Delete(3);

idx:=Students.First;
while idx is not null loop
dbms_output.put_line('The Customer name is ' ||Students(idx));
idx:=Students.next(idx);
end loop Display_loop;
end;

2.NESTED TABLE
          1.Nested table can be stored in database
          2. They Can be Indexed by only by Integer
          3.We can use the Multiset Operator To Perform set operation and to perform equality comparison on nested table
