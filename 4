Cursor
~ Oracle creates a memory area known as Context area for processing sql statement which contacin all the information needed for execution
of program
~the cursor in the pointer to that context area,PL/SQL area through cursor ;
~Cursor hold the row and we can give it name also;
~set of row hold by cursor called active set

there are two type of cursor:
1.Implicit
  Implicit cursor is automatically created by oracle whenever dml statement is executed
  whenever the dml(insert,update,delete) are executed implicit cursor is executed with them
  implicit cursor is called sql cursor
  they have following attribute:
  1. %Found
    Return TRUE if dml command execute and affected one or more rows or
    a select into affected one or more rows otherwise return False
  2.%ISOPEN
    always return false because sql cursor automatically get closed  after executing
  3.%not found
   It is opposite to %found,It return true if dml command affect no rows or select statement return no row
   otherwise its return false
  4.ROW count
    return the number of rows affected by unsert,update,delete or return by select statement
  
2.Explicit
  we can cerate cursor by giving reference to context area
  1.Declare
  2.open
  3.fetch data
  4.close
